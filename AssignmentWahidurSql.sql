#1. Create a table called employees with the following structure?
# emp_id (integer, should not be NULL and should be a primary key)Q
# emp_name (text, should not be NULL)Q
# age (integer, should have a check constraint to ensure the age is at least 18)Q
# email (text, should be unique for each employee)Q
# salary (decimal, with a default value of 30,000).
#Write the SQL query to create the above table with all constraint.

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,               -- emp_id as PRIMARY KEY and NOT NULL
    emp_name TEXT NOT NULL,                        -- emp_name as NOT NULL
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),                     -- age with CHECK constraint (age >= 18)
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,                     -- email should be unique with VARCHAR type
    salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000                   -- salary with a default value of 30,000
);


#2  2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.

#Ans:
#Purpose of Constraints :
#Constraints ensure **data integrity** by enforcing rules to maintain accuracy, consistency, and validity in a database.


#Common Types of Constraints :

#1. **NOT NULL**  
  # - Ensures a column cannot contain `NULL`.  
 #  - Example: `name TEXT NOT NULL`.

#2. **UNIQUE**  
   #- Ensures all values in a column are distinct.  
   #- Example: `email TEXT UNIQUE`.

#3. **PRIMARY KEY**  
   #- Combines `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` to uniquely identify each row.  
   #- Example: `emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`.

#4.**FOREIGN KEY**  
   #- Links columns to a primary key in another table to enforce relationships.  
   #- Example: `FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)`.

#5. **CHECK**  
   #- Ensures a column meets a condition.  
   #- Example: `age INTEGER CHECK (age >= 18)`.
#6. **DEFAULT**  
   #- Assigns a default value if none is provided.  
   #- Example: `salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000`.
#Benefits : 
#- Prevents invalid data.  
#- Maintains relationships between tables.  
#- Reduces errors and enforces business rules. 


#3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values?Justify your answer.
#Ans: Why Apply NOT NULL:
#To ensure a column always has a value, preventing missing or incomplete data.
 #Example: A username field must not be empty.

#Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?
#No, it cannot.


#4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.

#Ans: To add or remove constraints on an existing table, you can use the following SQL commands:
#1. Adding a Constraint
#To add a constraint, you use the ALTER TABLE statement with the ADD CONSTRAINT clause. Here's the syntax:
#ALTER TABLE table_name
#ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name constraint_type (column_name);

#Example: Adding a NOT NULL constraint on the email column:
#ALTER TABLE employees
#ADD CONSTRAINT email_not_null CHECK (email IS NOT NULL);

#2. Removing a Constraint
#To remove a constraint, you use the ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP CONSTRAINT clause. Here's the syntax:
#ALTER TABLE table_name
#DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;

#Example: Removing the email_not_null constraint:
#ALTER TABLE employees
#EDROP CONSTRAINT email_not_null;

#Uniqueness: A primary key uniquely identifies each row, and NULL is not a value.
#Implicit NOT NULL: Primary keys automatically enforce the NOT NULL constraint.
#Conclusion: Primary keys require valid, non-null values for data integrity.


#5.Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.

#Ans:
#When you violate a constraint during an insert, update, or delete, the database rejects the operation and shows an error message.
#Consequences:
#Insert: Fails if a value violates a NOT NULL, UNIQUE, or FOREIGN KEY constraint.
#Update: Fails if a change violates constraints like PRIMARY KEY or FOREIGN KEY.
#Delete: Fails if you try to delete a record referenced by another table (with a FOREIGN KEY).
#Example Error:
#Inserting an order with a non-existing customer:
#INSERT INTO orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id) VALUES (1, '2025-01-27', 999);

#Error message:
#ERROR:  insert or update on table "orders" violates foreign key constraint "orders_customer_id_fkey"
#DETAIL:  Key (customer_id)=(999) is not present in table "customers".

#6. You created a products table without constraints as follows: CREATE TABLE products (     product_id INT,     product_name VARCHAR(50),     price DECIMAL(10, 2));

#Ans:
#To modify the products table to meet the new requirements (making product_id a PRIMARY KEY and setting a default value for price), you can use the ALTER TABLE command.
#1. Make product_id a Primary Key:
#Since product_id should uniquely identify each product, we can add a PRIMARY KEY constraint to the product_id column.
#2. Set a Default Value for price:
#To set a default value of 50.00 for the price column, we can use the DEFAULT constraint.
#SQL Commands:
#-- Add a PRIMARY KEY constraint to product_id
#ALTER TABLE products
#ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product_id PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

-- Set a default value of 50.00 for price
#ALTER TABLE products
#ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;


#7. You have two tables:
   
   #Students:
#student_id            student_name       class_id
#1                           Alice                       101
#2                           Bob                         102
#3                           Charlie                    101

 #Classes:
#class_id             class_name
#101                       Math
#102                       Science 
#103                       History
#Write a query to fetch the student_name and class_name for each student using an INNER JOIN.

#Ans: To fetch the student_name and class_name for each student by using an INNER JOIN, you need to join the Students and Classes tables on the class_id field. Hereâ€™s the SQL query to achieve that:

#SELECT s.student_name, c.class_name
#FROM Students s
#INNER JOIN Classes c
#ON s.class_id = c.class_id;

#8. Consider the following three tables:
#Orders:
#orders      order_date         customer_id
#1             2024-01-01          101
#2             2024-01-03          102

#Customers:
#customer_id      customer_name  
#101                     Alice 
#102                     Bob

#product_id      product_name        order_id
#1                     Laptop                     1
#2                     Phone                      NULL

#Write a query that shows all order_id, customer_name, and product_name, ensuring that all products are listed even if they are not associated with an order  Hint: (use INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN)


#Ans: Ans: To fetch all order_id, customer_name, and product_name, ensuring all products are listed (even without an order), use the following query with INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN:
#SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name
#FROM Orders o
#INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
#LEFT JOIN Products p ON o.order_id = p.order_id;


#9. Given the following tables:
 #Sales: 
#sale_id      product_id          amount
#1                     101                 500
#2                     102                300
#3                     101                700

#product_id       product_name
# 101                  Laptop
#102                 Phone
#Write a query to find the total sales amount for each product using an INNER JOIN and the SUM() function.

 #Ans: To find the total sales amount for each product, you can use an INNER JOIN to combine the Sales and Products tables and then use the SUM() function to calculate the total sales amount for each product.
#SQL Query:
#SELECT p.product_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
#FROM Sales s
#INNER JOIN Products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
#GROUP BY p.product_name;

#example Result:
#product_name | total_sales
#---------------------------
#Laptop       | 1200
#Phone        | 300
#The total sales for Laptop is 500 + 700 = 1200.
#The total sales for Phone is 300.


#10. You are given three tables:
#Orders:
#order_id            order_date       customer_id
#1                          2024-01-02              1
#2                          2024-01-05              2

 #Customers:
#customer_id             customer_name
#1                                 Alice
#2                                 Bob 
#Order_Details:
#order_id            product_id        quantity
#1                             101                  2
#2                             102                  1
#3                             101                  3
#Write a query to display the order_id, customer_name, and the quantity of products ordered by each customer using an INNER JOIN between all three tables. Note - The above-mentioned questions don't require any dataset.

#Ans: To display the order_id, customer_name, and the quantity of products ordered, use this INNER JOIN query:
#SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, od.quantity
#FROM Orders o
#INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
#INNER JOIN Order_Details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id;

#####Normalisation & CTE

### 1. First Normal Form (1NF):#a.Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF. Explain how you would normalize it to achieve 1NF.
#A **CTE** is a temporary result set that you can use within a query to simplify complex operations.

#Ans:SQL Queries to Achieve 1NF

CREATE TABLE film_special_features (
    film_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    special_feature VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (film_id, special_feature),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id)
);
#Insert data into the new table by splitting the special_features values:
INSERT INTO film_special_features (film_id, special_feature)
SELECT film_id, TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(special_features, ',', n), ',', -1)) AS special_feature
FROM film
JOIN (SELECT 1 AS n UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7) numbers
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(special_features) - CHAR_LENGTH(REPLACE(special_features, ',', '')) >= n - 1;

#Remove the special_features column from the film table
ALTER TABLE film DROP COLUMN special_features;

#Result:
#The film_special_features table now stores each feature for each film in separate rows, 
#ensuring that each row has atomic values and satisfying 1NF.



##2. Second Normal Form (2NF):a. Choose a table in Sakila and describe how you would determine whether it is in 2NF. 
#If it violates 2NF, explain the steps to normalize it.


#ans: SQL Queries to Normalize film_category to 2NF:
CREATE TABLE film_last_update (
    film_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    last_update TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (film_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id)
);

#Move the last_update data to the new table:

INSERT INTO film_last_update (film_id, last_update)
SELECT DISTINCT film_id, last_update
FROM film_category;

#Remove last_update from the film_category table:
ALTER TABLE film_category DROP COLUMN last_update;

#Result:
#Now, the film_category table contains only the composite primary key (film_id, category_id) and does not have the partial dependency on last_update. The film_last_update table stores the last_update information for each film.
#The table is in 1NF.
#There are no partial dependencies.
#The table satisfies 2NF.


##3. Third Normal Form (3NF):a. Identify a table in Sakila that violates 3NF. Describe the transitive dependencies 
#present and outline the steps to normalize the table to 3NF.

#Ans: SQL Queries to Normalize address to 3NF:
CREATE TABLE city_country (
    city_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    country_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,  -- Adjust to match country table
    PRIMARY KEY (city_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (city_id) REFERENCES city(city_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES country(country_id)
);

#adding 
ALTER TABLE address ADD COLUMN country_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED;
#update 
UPDATE address a
JOIN city_country c ON a.city_id = c.city_id
SET a.country_id = c.country_id;

#remove
ALTER TABLE address DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_address_city;
ALTER TABLE address DROP COLUMN city_id;

ALTER TABLE address ADD CONSTRAINT fk_country_id FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES country(country_id);

#These queries normalize the address table to 3NF by eliminating the transitive dependency




#4. Normalization Process:
#a. Take a specific table in Sakila and guide through the process of normalizing it from the initial unnormalized form up to at least 2NF

# Unnormalized Form (UNF)
-- Original (unnormalized) `film_actor` table
CREATE TABLE film_actor_unf (
    actor_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
    film_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
    actor_name VARCHAR(100),
    film_title VARCHAR(100),
    last_update TIMESTAMP
);

#Convert to 1NF
-- Table already in 1NF as it has atomic columns
CREATE TABLE film_actor_1nf (
    actor_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
    film_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
    last_update TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (actor_id, film_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (actor_id) REFERENCES actor(actor_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id)
);

#Convert to 2NF

-- Create the `film_actor` table in 2NF
CREATE TABLE film_actor_2nf (
    actor_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
    film_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
    last_update TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (actor_id, film_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (actor_id) REFERENCES actor(actor_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES film(film_id)
);

    film_title,
    rental_duration,
    rental_rank
FROM FilmRentalRank;

#9.CTE and Filtering:

    c.email,
    c.address_id,
    crc.rental_count
FROM CustomerRentalCount crc
JOIN customer c ON crc.customer_id = c.customer_id;

#10. CTE for Date Calculations:

    SELECT
        YEAR(r.rental_date) AS rental_year,
        MONTH(r.rental_date) AS rental_month,

)
SELECT
    rental_year,

    rental_count
FROM MonthlyRentalCount
ORDER BY rental_year, rental_month;

#together, using the film_actor table

WITH ActorPairs AS (
    SELECT 
        fa1.actor_id AS actor1_id,

    FROM film_actor fa1
    JOIN film_actor fa2 ON fa1.film_id = fa2.film_id
